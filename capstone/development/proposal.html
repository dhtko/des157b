            For the capstone project, I am planning to design a far future where circular waste has fully adapted. In this future, every material and product is trackable, and governments have made several regulation to ensure circular waste is in action. The main target audience of the project is sustainable designers because by designing the world where circular waste becomes real, I want to motivate sustainable designers to design products that can guide the present world to the preferable future. The main lens for the project is the speculative design because I have some experience with the type of design (currently taking speculative design course) and such a design can develop the future in a strategic manner. Furthermore, the speculative design can develop both the world and the product, so there are some flexibility as the project progresses.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the project is still in early development phase, I am considering to incorporate the following features for the project:
            <ul>
                <li>Illustration or 3D models of the products related to the speculative future</li>
                <li>JQuery Libraries (i.e. Animation on Scroll)</li>
                <li>Background Music or Sound Effects</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            At this stage, there are several concerns that needs to be addressed. First, I still have not narrowed down form the larger idea. Currently, I am having a dilemma between highlighting the speculative world or emphasizing on a specific product that reflects one aspect of the world. Next, I still have no clue if I need data for the project and the method to intertwine the data to the project, if needed. Finally, I have zero experience with 3D model: I don't know what program to create the model or how to incorporate the model to the website. I might not have to incorporate 3D model, but if I do, I will have a hard time for sure.
