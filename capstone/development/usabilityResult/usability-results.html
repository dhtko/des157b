            <h2>Key Findings from the Testing</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Participants have missed the first interactive feature. I think this observation occured because there were no sub-text or guidance text for users to 'click' the section. In addition, the lack of anchoring on the area ressulted in users 'slipping' away from the section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participants were confused on the product detailed information interactive section, especially after when they opened a section. I think this observation occured because there were no dedicated close buttons on the sections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The participants experienced a difficulty on reading the line graph because the colors for the grid of the graph is similar to the background color.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Reflection from the Testing</h2>
            <p>
                The participants mostly interacted the project as expected: scrolling down and interact each section in an intended order. However, I noticed that all participants skipped the first section and some of the animations were already finished when the users reached the section. When I asked the participants' impression on the project, they all said the same expression: "we should take our attention to our garabage and start recycle, or else we will end up in a future where we eat our own garbage."<br>
                <br>After performing the usability testing, here are planned modifications for future versions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the 'ending' section</li>
                <li>Feature that triggers the animaiton when a section is in the scope</li>
                <li>Sub-text for the first section to ensure users start the website by clicking the section and trigger the hidden animation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
