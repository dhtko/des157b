            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    For the capstone project, I am planning to design a possible future where circular waste has fully adapted. Currently, people are creating garbage rapidly; the current recycling system does not keep up with its pace. Thereby, in the speculative future, humanity adapted the circular waste by consuming the garbage via FlavorNeutral5000, a speculative 3D food printer that can produce consumable tasteless liquid packets that contain all the required nutrients to survive by processing garbage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main target audience of the project is sustainable designers and speculative designers because, through the project, I want to motivate the target audience to use their design abilities to produce various products that can lead to a future in which humanity has adapted circular waste and saved our planet from a pile of garbage.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The main objective of the project is to alert the users to the current problem regarding the massive production of garbage. In addition, I want to ask the users the following question:
                </p>

                <p id="theQuestion">
                    <em>"Will the technology set humanity free from the environment-related problems or create a new system of control and inequality?"</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to raise the question because I started to feel that all the eco-friendly movements and products force people to sacrifice their lifestyle too much. Yet, people believe that they are the future. Thus, by depicting an extreme scenario (where food, waste, and survival are intertwined), I want people to think critically about the eco-friendly movements.
                </p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Before developing the website, I have to resolve two major design problems. Therefore, I conducted two comparative analyses to gain the design solutions.
                </p>

                <div class="analysisSection">
                    <p>
                        <em>1st website</em>

                        <br>First website that I analyzed is materialflows.net, a website that introduces the circular economy and provides an interactive tool that visualizes circularity. Analyzing this website allowed me to gain a solution of using an infographic (line graph in this website) to display effectively and efficiently.<br> 

                        <br>One of the major problems when I designed the project was to provide the data to convince the users that the production rate of garbage is high that the current recycling rate is not effective enough. Initially, I thought about using a density map that displays the garbage production in the red area and the recycling rate in the blue area. However, the result was underwhelming: the map does not display the data in an organized manner, and the red and blue areas caused a cognitive load. Thus, when I analyzed the website, I redesigned everything and decided to use the multi-line graph. One of the characteristics that I liked about the website's line graph was the customization option because the feature allows storing multiple data points in a single area. In addition, it separates the multiple data points, which reduces the cognitive load.<br>

                        <br>Therefore, I incorporated the learning outcomes and applied them to the project by creating a line graph with multiple selection options. This design choice allowed me to present multiple data into a single graph area without causing cognitive load. In addition, I was able to collect more data points (initially, the planned data points were four, but the final data points were seven).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysisSection">
                    <p>
                        <em>2nd website</em>
                        <br>The second website that I analyzed is RMI, a website that introduces the circular economy of batteries for electric vehicles. From analyzing the website, I found a solution to the problem of displaying the impact of a product (change in data) in a dynamic manner.<br>

                        <br>Another major problem that I need to resolve is how to display the impact of the speculative product over time. Unlike the first problem, I did not have any initial idea because I was completely lost. To visually display the impact, I had to create a design solution that changes the data and creates a movement at the same time. Then, I encountered this website, which utilizes a group of graphs with a control section, where users can manipulate the graph by applying an input.<br>

                        <br>This unique method mesmerized me because I never thought of making the graph responsive. In addition, when I interact with various inputs, I was able to acquire the expected trend, even though I did not read the entire article. Therefore, inspired by the analysis, I designed the reactive chart that responds to the range input that the users interact with.<br>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <div class="content">                
                <p>
                    There are three main sections in this project: the beginning (the header), the 'Current Situation' section, and the speculative design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the beginning, I wanted to depict a possible future where the production rate of garbage gets out of control, and our planet is filled with garbage. Therefore, I created a visual design where multiple images of garbage bags (duplicates with different sizes) filled the clean scenery. When it comes to the animation of garbage bags, I initially designed the garbage bags to be dropped from the sky. However, the effect has changed to the classic hidden-showing effect for two reasons. First, my coding capability and the timeframe limited the initial design. Second, the initial animation idea does not match the future because garbage dropping from the sky implies that in the possible future, our environment is contaminated that the nature produces garbage from the sky (which is not what I want to depict).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the 'Current Situation' section, I utilized the grey-scale background with darker progression. I chose such a color theme in the section because I want to create a dark, gloomy tone through the color theme. For accent color, I used green because it was the color that can grab attention without creating a strong edge that causes eyestrain. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the speculative design section, I applied the bright green-turquoise gradient because I want to use nature-related colors and bring a positive tone, which reflects a bright speculative future. Also, the selected color theme created a big contrast between the 'Current Situation' section, which indirectly alarms the shift in section and tone during the interaction. For the doughnut charts, I used the cherry, orange, and green colors for the positive impact and brown and grey colors for the negative effects. This color choice highlights the progression of positive changes over time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the project reached its end, I applied the turquoise to black gradient because I wanted to add a weight at the end. Also, the addition of black makes the concluding sentence impactful.
                </p>

                        For the project, I utilized the typical website format: a single page with multiple sections. I used such a format because I want to emphasize the narrative over the interactive element, as such a format allows users to navigate the project at their own pace. In addition, the website is widely used, so the users will not be stunned when navigating the project. However, I added a twist to the scrolling by adding an arrow-key navigation: the down arrow to scroll down and the up arrow to scroll up. I added this navigation because I want to mimic the PowerPoint (or Slides) effect. This effect reduces the cognitive load (section by section), and it also brings the theme of the project: the product page of a speculative 3D food printer that prints food with garbage to save our planet. Initially, the section-by-section navigation was created with the 'wheel' event, but I switched to the keydown event because the wheel event acted weird in a touchpad.

                <div class="column">
                    <p>There are several interactions and animations included in the project:</p>

                    <ul>

                            <img src="./images/lineGraph.gif" alt="lineGraphDemonstartion">
                            <em>Line graphs with multiple selection options</em> This interaction provides the data to convince people that the production rate of garbage is increasing while the recycling rate is low. I chose a line graph over other forms because a line graph is an infographic that visually displays the trend with lines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img src="./images/numCounting.gif" alt="numCountingAnimation">
                            <em>Number counting animations</em> This animation highlights the key changes of nature soon if the trend presented in the previous section continues. The animation adds volume to the numerical values (makes the numerical value higher). In addition, the animation grabs the attention to the content of the section, which guides the audience to read the numerical value and the meaning behind the numbers
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img src="./images/firstTextanimation.gif" alt="transitionTextAnimation">
                            <em>Text animation for the transition section</em> The section incorporated such an animation was meant to bridge the two main chapters: one with gloomy and dark tone, and another with bright tone. Note the big change in tone, so I had to add an animation that pushes the heavy, gloomy tone out before moving to another chapter. Therefore, I included a text animation to refresh the dark tone. Also, the delay of the animation creates an anticipation and a little surprise that alarms the shift of tone.
                        </li>

                            <img src="./images/productInfo.gif" alt='productInfoInteraction'>
                            <em>Interaction of detailed information on the 3D food printer</em> The section incorporates such an interaction because I want to make sure that users do not get confused in this section, which contains the most important content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img src="./images/doughnutChart.gif" alt="doughnutChartInteraction">
                            <em>Doughnut charts with a slider</em> This interaction was designed to visually display the impact of the product over time. The interaction takes the range input, and as the input changes, the doughnut chart updates with the new value. I chose the doughnut charts over other factors because the doughnut charts change the size of color blocks, which visualizes the change in data in motion. While a bar chart was another option, I found that doughnut charts create more dynamic motion than bar graphs.

                            <img src="./images/illustrations.gif" alt="illustrationSlideshow">
                            <em>Slideshow of illustrations with captions</em> This interaction is a simple slideshow with visible captions when the mouseover event happens. I did not add any fancy animations because I want the users to solely enjoy the narrative text and see the visuals. Therefore, I needed to create an interaction that is simple and direct, which is the slideshow interaction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img src="./images/secondTextanimation.gif" alt="endingTextAnimation">
                            <em>Text animation for ending</em> This animation was selected because the animation adds the weight to the closing sentences. Compared to the text animation used for the transition section, this text animation was designed to close the project. Therefore, the animation is more heavy and dedicated to the other text animation.

                <p>After completing the first version of the capstone project, I executed a usability test to identify any areas to improve or capture any unexpected errors. A total of three participants joined the usability testing, and the following results were observed:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Participants have missed the first interactive feature. I think this observation occurred because there were no sub-text or guidance text for users to 'click' the section. In addition, the lack of anchoring on the area resulted in users 'slipping' away from the section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants were confused on the product detailed information interactive section, especially after when they opened a section. I think this observation occurred because there were no dedicated close buttons on the sections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The participants experienced a difficulty on reading the line graph because the colors for the grid of the graph is similar to the background color.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <p>
                    After conducting the usability test, I realized that most key findings occurred due to the lack of supplementary texts of interactions and navigations of the project. This learning was interesting to me because I thought minimal interface would help the users to navigate the interface. However, I was wrong: the minimal interface induced confusion among the users. Therefore, I incorporated the supplementary texts on the interaction features. In addition, I realized that users scroll down the website in the middle of interaction of garbage bags. While one participant scrolled down as an accident, but other two participants intentionally scrolled down because it was bored. This was totally unexpected result, which I wanted to observe from an usability test. Thus, I disabled the scrolling effect during the interaction of garbage bags. Finally, I observed that section-by-section navigation with mouse wheels acted not as expected in touchpad. I think this occurred because the touchpad is too sensitive. So, I changed the interaction method from the wheel to keydown event.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I decided to continue working on the project, I would like to add an interactive tutorial of the 3D food printer. This addition will help the users understand the concept of the speculative product more directly and help visualize the use case of the product in real life scenarios. Also, it would be nice if I incorporated a 3D model of the 34D food printer instead of 2D graphics.

                    Overall, I really enjoyed working on the capstone project because I learned a lot from it. First, this was my first project that is catered to a target audience. Previous projects from interactive media were centered around myself, so the capstone project was a completely new challenge for me. Next, I learned how to work with JS library, which expanded my design capability. In DES 157A, there were several design concepts that I scrapped because of the coding capability. However, with JS library, I was able to create the project as the design comp (no more sacrifice!). Especially, I enjoyed working with text animation (Textify.js) because such animation was visually interesting. Finally, I learned how to analyze the website into practical codes. Before working with the capstone project, I did not think too much. However, when I explore various resources for the project, I started to gain interest on the technical aspects of the websites. In the end, I started to inspect the technical details on some of my bookmarked websites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project means a lot to me because it was the first website that expanded to full viewport. In the previous projects, I mainly followed the viewport of 1200px by 750px because I was used to the such proportion. However, I decided to break my comfort zone and expanded the boundary to the full viewport. Initially, I struggled a lot on creating design comp because the full viewport felt like endless space that I need to fill. However, as I research various websites, I learned that I do not have to fill everything; sometimes, having a heavy whitespace can be beneficial. In addition, as I iterate the design comp, I started to get used the space. Overall, I successfully broke the comfort zone and developed my design capability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most challenging part of the project was the developing the section-by-section navigation because the navigation iterated several times, with a major challenge in each iteration. In the first iteration (scroll wheel), the navigation acted too quickly that it skipped some part and it skipped the section whenever I started on the first section. In the second iteration, I moved the mechanism from scroll wheel to the keydown events. However, I found that scrollIntoView does not work whenever I added behavior properties, and the navigation always moved 1-2 inch more. In the end, I solved the issue by applying event.preventDefault(). Overall, the experience with the feature was tough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most rewarding accomplishment of the project would be the section that incorporates doughnut charts and the slider. While creating the doughnut charts was simple, building the mechanism that tracks the input value from the slider took some challenge. Thankfully, I learned 'DOMContentLoaded' and I managed to develop the interaction as intended. The result was more effective than I expected, and this section is definitely my favorite.
