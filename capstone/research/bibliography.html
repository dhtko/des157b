                The main purpose of this website is to present a project that solves the issue of increasing coconut waste. The project concluded by addressing its successful demonstration of using coconut waste as filament for 3D printing. While the coconut project itself may not be directly related to my project, I was able to understand how to develop a project related to circular waste. Overall, I was able to know how to tackle the circular waste issue and gained a possible perspective to develop my project.

                The main purpose of this website is to disrupt the normalized thought patterns around waste by creating a concept of plastic food. The project installed physical models of Plastic Food in the cafeteria of the Amsterdam University Library building, and resulted in 719 page views, and some spent a prolonged time. This particular website has a somewhat direct relationship to my project because it created a website project on the speculative design of circular waste. From the website, I was able to see how to link speculative design and a website format.

                The main purpose of this website is to present six futuristic design concepts that can lead to a wasteless society. The introduced concepts are mostly in the architecture area, and the website hopes that such conceptual design may be the starting point to develop various design ideas for circular waste. This website has the strongest relationship to the project because it presents speculative circular waste concepts and elaborates on how such concepts can potentially lead to the desired future. From the website, I was able to observe good examples of speculative design that have the potential to shape the future.
