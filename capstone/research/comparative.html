                This website introduces the circular economy and provides an interactive tool that visualizes circularity. The user experience of the website in general is straightforward, but nothing stands out since there are no visually astonishing UI elements. The color choice of the website remains fairly simple: white for background, black for text, and orange for highlights and title. I do like the color scheme of the website, I was able to easily distinguish the keyword within the text. Also, the orange color for section titles helped me to understand the informational hierarchy.<br>

                <br>When it comes to the interactive tool, the website allows users to somewhat customize the range of data, like the two scopes (total, per capita), countries, visualization options, and the range of years. While the website did not make the tool visually pretty, it does have all the necessary features to meet expectations. What I liked about the tool is the visualization option, because having various visualization options provides a different user experience. Also, each visualization option comes with its dedicated customization option.

                This website introduces the circular economy of batteries for electric vehicles. The main content of the website consists of three parts, and each part can be accessed by clicking a tab located at the top portion of the main section. The color scheme of the website is white for the background, grey-black for text, and blue for titles. I enjoyed the color scheme because the blue color is easy to distinguish from the rest and sets the professional tone for the website.<br>

                <br>Each section starts with text for information and graphics to supplement the text. As the user scrolls down, they encounter the interactive area. Unlike a typical interactive manner, this website utilized a dedicated control section (located at the left with the title 'User Inputs'). When the user controls the input value and submits, the graphs in the area visualize the data based on the submission. I enjoyed this method because the dedicated section induces a sense of control for the user. Also, seeing many graphs (there are more than 5 graphs in the interactive area) reacting to the user's input amplifies the sense of control.
